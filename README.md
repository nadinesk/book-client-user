# Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The BookCrowd crowdsources books that other users have enjoyed, to give others ideas for new books to read.

Users can list books they want to share as ideas for others to read, and they can search for books, with results from the Google API.
